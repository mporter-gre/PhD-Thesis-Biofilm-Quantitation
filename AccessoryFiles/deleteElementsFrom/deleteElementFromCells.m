function cellsOut = deleteElementFromCells(elementsForDeletion, cells)
%Use to remove an entry from an array of cells keeping the order of the other
%elements in tact with no gaps. {'one' 'two' 'three' 'four' 'five'} becomes 
%{'one' 'two' 'four' 'five'} and not {'one' 'two' {} 'four' 'five'} eg.
%Do cellsOut = deleteElementFromCells(element, cells); where 'element' is
%the entry to be deleted. A vector of elements to be deleted can also be
%passed in.
