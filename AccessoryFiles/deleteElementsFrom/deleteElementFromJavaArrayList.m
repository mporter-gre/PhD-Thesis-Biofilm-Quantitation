function arrayListOut = deleteElementFromJavaArrayList(elementsForDeletion, arrayList)
%Use to remove an entry from a Java array list keeping the order of the other
%elements in tact with no gaps. [1 2 3 4 5] becomes [1 2 4 5] and not 
%[1 2 [] 4 5] eg.
%Do arrayListOut = deleteElementFromJavaArrayList(element, arrayList); where 'element' is
%the entry to be deleted. A vector of elements to be deleted can also be
%passed in.
