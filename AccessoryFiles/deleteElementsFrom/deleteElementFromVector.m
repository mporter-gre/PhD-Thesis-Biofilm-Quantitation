function vectorOut = deleteElementFromVector(elementsForDeletion, vector)
%Use to remove an entry from a vector keeping the order of the other
%elements in tact with no gaps. [1 2 3 4 5] becomes [1 2 4 5] and not 
%[1 2 [] 4 5] eg.
%Do vectorOut = deleteElementFromVector(element, vector); where 'element' is
%the entry to be deleted. A vector of elements to be deleted can also be
%passed in.
